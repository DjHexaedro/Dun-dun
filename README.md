# Dun-dun

You can download the latest version of the game [here](https://djhexaedro.itch.io/dun-dun)

Currently only a single boss is available to play, with three different difficulties to choose from. Gameplay consists in dodging the boss' attacks and collecting crystals to damage it. The more you wait before you collect a crystal, the more damage it will do, but if you wait too much it'll break and disappear.

## Contributing & bug reporting

The game is currently very early in development, and is being worked on as a hobby. Right now I do not accept pull requests as most of the fun in this is figuring out how to fix bugs and do what I want to do, so this repository exists as a bug tracker (I do accept issues) and as a way to view the game's code.
