# Dun-dun

2D bullet-hell style shooter.

Currently only a single boss with three different variants is avaliable to play. Gameplay consists in dodging the bosses' attacks and collecting crystals to damage it. The more you wait before you collect a crystal, the more damage it will do, but if you wait too much it'll break and disappear.

## Contributing & bug reporting

The game is currently very early in development, and is being worked on as a hobby. Right now I do not accept pull requests as most of the fun in this is figuring out how to fix bugs and do what I want to do, so this repository exists as a bug tracker (I do accept issues) and as a way to view the game's code.
